I'm currently a Master's student in the Department of Biology and Wildlife at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. I hold a B.S. in Biological Sciences from UAF and a B.F.A. in Musical Theater from the Boston Conservatory. 

My research thus far has primarily focused on third generation (i.e. Nanopore) sequencing technology, software-based enrichment techniques, methodology development, and antimicrobial resistance in microbial communities. I am passionate about translating research into innovative solutions for real world challenges.

*More to come!*
